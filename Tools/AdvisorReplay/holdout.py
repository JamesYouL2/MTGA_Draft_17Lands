"""Rebuild the app's dataset from a game dump, with and without the sampled drafts.

    python Tools/AdvisorReplay/holdout.py --games game_data_public.FRA.PremierDraft.csv.gz \
        --drafts drafts.json.gz --dataset FRA_PremierDraft_All_Data.json.gz \
        --rebuilt rebuilt.json.gz --heldout heldout.json.gz

The two datasets differ only in their win rates: --rebuilt counts every game in
the dump, and --heldout leaves out the games of the drafts in --drafts. A rate
exists where the card has MIN_SAMPLES games in hand in the whole dump, as 17Lands
hides thinner ones from the app, and samples is that whole-dump count, which
reads no results. So both datasets have the same cards rated and the same
shrinkage. Cards the app has no data for, such as basic lands, stay unrated. GIH WR, GNS WR and IWD are replaced; the other fields stay the app's,
which the advisor doesn't read for scoring, except ALSA, which reads no results.
Standard library only.
